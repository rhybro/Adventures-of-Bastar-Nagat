Having reunited with and busted out his old friend and mentor the imperial senator [[Hethan Romund]] from an imperial prison complex on Spintir. Romund has told Bastar of the Empire's search for an ancient sith Temple believed lost that contains a sith holocron. 

Together [[Hethan Romund|Romund]] and Bastar have retreived their HWK 290 and are heading to the planet Tarak to find the infamous slicer Maia Tamora who should be able to break the encryption on the stolen imperial data rod that shows the temple's location.

After arriving at the cloud city of Iziz. The smell of toasting nuts and the sound distant revelry waft lazily through the air as Bastar and Romund begin their search

----

After trying to find Maia on the cloud city of Iziz, Bastar and Romund noticed they were being followed by mysterious bounty hunters luring them down a back alley the two companions made short work of them.

But in their haste to hide the bodies it seems that one of the local shop owners on the promenade has alerted the guards of the Haerana Cartel to suspicious activity who have increased their presence in area which could make it more difficult to talk with Maira during their search the pair were made aware that due to her debts to the Haerana cartel that Maia may not be able to help. 

Arriving at Maia's shop Romund and Bastar find her busy hearing a distinctive ca click a mechanised battle droid from the clone wars springs to life. Maia looks up from her workbench acknowleging the newcomers. 

After discussing their need for a slicer to crack an imperial data rod Maia informs our companions that she won't touch imperial rods for fear of bringing the empire down on Taras and making her more of a target of the [[Haerana Cartel]]. 

Following a long conversation trying to convince her to help Maia does offer to give Bastar the contact details of a slicer who asks fewer questions in exchange for getting her son Saul released from Haerana custody.  

She tells the pair that as part of her investigations she's discovered that Saul is being held on the 156th level of the city at the heart of Haerana territory. She advises them to go talk to Bleshk Callor the head of the Cartel.
