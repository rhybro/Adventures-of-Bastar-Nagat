Romund and Bastar head for the 156th floor and Haerana Territory.

Knowing the trip ahead will have risks the pair make a surprisingly uneventful journey. Followed closely by a small number of agents they find themselves in front of the Singing Twi'lek the main bar on this level and [[Bleshk Callor]]'s centre of operations. 

A few security officers are drinking the night away in the corner watching a pair of Twi'lek dancers perform.  The bar is quiet the Twi'lek bartender looks at Bastar with a wary eye as the former Jedi approaches. 

Bastar orders a Mandalorian Sunrise before asking if the man has seen Bleshk Callor. Getting a frosty response of yes he offers an additional payment for such a well made drink in order to incentivise more information stating that he has some business to resolve with the Crime Boss.  Seeing that the bartender will need more incentive Bastar ups his offer by 100 credits.  

The bartender refuses as the security guards note the discussion and make their way towards the bar.  

Seeing that fighting in Callor's bar would likely not go well Romund and Bastar make their way towards the exit. 

The guards follow drawing their blaster pistols seeing no other option Bastar pulls out his lightsaber and proceeds to disable the three guards with help from a wookie Reeosk that Bastar managed to save from a blaster bolt to the face. 

After the dust has settled the group can see no sight of the bartender , hearing a scream they head towards the back of the bar but find nothing except for an oily coating on the wall and air that's hazy with industrial smoke and no sign of the bartender. 

Looking around  Bastar sees nothing but a few groups of species and brightly coloured skin on the street outside and deep in conversations of their own ignoring the scuffle inside the bar. 

Briefly talking to the patrons outside Bastar learns nothing new and no one saw anything leaving the bar. 

Hearing shattering glass the group head for the sound hoping for some break in the case. 

Arriving at the source of the sound over years of training and his attunement to the world Bastar notices a small scrap of ripped clothing on the jagged edges of glass in the windowsill, the same as the bartender's clothing, but the window is easily on the second floor making it difficult to enter.  

Hearing the sound of rapidly approaching sirens Bastar quickly makes his way inside. Trying at the door he finds it locked and sealed shut but notices a slightly opened window on the second floor as the security vehicles swoop past on their way to the bar. 

 Tapping into the force Bastar leaps in through the window narrowly missing a piece of plasteel in the windowsill causing him to take 1 strain. He hears the beep-boop chatter of bots nearby and the sizzling sound of an energy field. 

He hears the voice of the bartender from the shadows and the whine of a blaster charging. 

"Please I have not come here to cause trouble all I want is to get Saul back, if you can tell me where Bleshk Callor is or get me an audience with him I would be in your debt"

The bartender looks at Bastar a troubled look on his face he moves closer his blaster lowering. 

"Look Bleshk and the Haerana aren't well liked here, but his goons are everywhere. After your entrance back there I'm sure they've marked you up. If you really want to find Callor and this prisoner then you'll need to find a way into the hanger bay on this level.  He holds up in an old republic ship, The Judgement, His lieutenants go there every so often to deliver their tithe. But there's a lot of guards and that ship isn't packing pop guns either if he senses for one second that anything's amiss he'll be out of there and hitting you with something even your fancy laser sword there won't stop."
