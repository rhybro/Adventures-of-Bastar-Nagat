### The Judgement

- Bastar manages to enter the ship disguised as a guard and quickly gets to a terminal. Finding the terminal occupied he convinces the guard there to go to the mess hall for a slice of Kimbok pie. While the guard is gone he manages to slice the computer and find the location of Saul's cell. 
    
- Coming out of the terminal room, Basdtar is stopped by a former clone trooper for not saluting a superior officer. Bastar brushes it off as tiredness and manages to convince the officer to let him go. Arriving back at the hanger he finds it deserted. 
    
- Finds Saul being beaten up by guards for a prison escape along with a young woman. Convinces the guards they're needed in the ship by the Boss.
    
- Manages to have Reeoshk create a distraction at the front gate by firing his bowcaster after slicing through the computers for the forcefield. Bastar, Reeoshk and Saul have a running fire fight back to the elevator with Reeoshk just making it before the doors close.
